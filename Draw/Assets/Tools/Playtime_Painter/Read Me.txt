Thank you for using Playtime Painter. 

The Asset is being constantly developed and there are many features yet to come. 
If something looks like a bug or just feels unintuitive, feel free to use one of the Contact options below to let me know.


HOW TO USE:
Attach PlaytimePainter Component to the GameObject you want to edit. Component's interface contains all the Texture editing
and mesh editing functionality. More in Online Documentation.

IMPORTANT TO KNOW:
Component more often prioratizes time-saving over being cautious. For example, it will automatically set "Is readable" 
for texture currently selected for editing and will create a .PNG RGBA copy of it to edit if current version is of a wrong format.
I created it for a very specific goal: to try stuff out as fast as possible. It's easy to edit things, but as a result, it's possible
to accidentally do an unwanted change to your Assets. Still, if something like that happens, I'll appreciate the feedback.


Hope you will enjoy the Asset, and please join a Discord channel (link below).
